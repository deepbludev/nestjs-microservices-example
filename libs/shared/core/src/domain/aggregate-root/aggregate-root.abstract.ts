/**
 * @class Aggregate
 * @classdesc Aggregate is a base class for all domain aggregate roots.
 * Encapsulate and are composed of entity classes and value objects that change together in a business transaction.
 * Aggregates are a transactional graph of model objects.
 * Aggregate root should be an entity, an aggregate can even be a single entity.
 * Aggregate can keep a reference to other aggregate roots,
 * but not to other entity classes which are not aggregate roots themselves.
 * Aggregate should not keep a reference to other aggregate root entity classes if those other entities
 * do not change together with this aggregate root entity.
 * Aggregate can also keep the id of another entity, but keeping too many foreign key ids is a code smell.
 * If deleting an entity has a cascade effect on the other entities referenced by class in the object graph,
 * these entities are part of the same aggregate, if not, they should not be inside this aggregate.
